  page: '243-269'
  abstract: 'Smart contracts are programs running on cryptocurrency (e.g., Ethereum)
    blockchains, whose popularity stem from the possibility to perform financial transactions,
    such as payments and auctions, in a distributed environment without need for any
    trusted third party. Given their financial nature, bugs or vulnerabilities in
    these programs may lead to catastrophic consequences, as witnessed by recent attacks.
    Unfortunately, programming smart contracts is a delicate task that requires strong
    expertise: Ethereum smart contracts are written in Solidity, a dedicated language
    resembling JavaScript, and shipped over the blockchain in the EVM bytecode format.
    In order to rigorously verify the security of smart contracts, it is of paramount
    importance to formalize their semantics as well as the security properties of
    interest, in particular at the level of the bytecode being executed.'

  title: From Hoare Logic to Matching Logic Reachability
  container-title: Proceedings of the 18th international symposium on formal methods
    (fm’12)
  collection-title: LNCS
  publisher: Springer
  page: '387-402'
  volume: '7436'
  abstract: 'Matching logic reachability has been recently proposed as an alternative
    program verification approach. Unlike Hoare logic, where one defines a language-specific
    proof system that needs to be proved sound for each language separately, matching
    logic reachability provides a \*language-independent\* and \*sound\* proof system
    that directly uses the trusted operational semantics of the language as axioms.
    Matching logic reachability thus has a clear practical advantage: it eliminates
    the need for an additional semantics of the same language in order to reason about
    programs, and implicitly eliminates the need for tedious soundness proofs. What
    is not clear, however, is whether matching logic reachability is as powerful as
    Hoare logic. This paper introduces a technique to mechanically translate Hoare
    logic proof derivations into equivalent matching logic reachability proof derivations.
    The presented technique has two consequences: first, it suggests that matching
    logic reachability has no theoretical limitation over Hoare logic; and second,
    it provides a new approach to prove Hoare logics sound.'

  title: 'KEVM: A complete semantics of the ethereum virtual machine'
  title-short: KEVM
  container-title: Computer security foundations symposium
  abstract: 'A developing field of interest for the distributed systems and applied
    cryptography communities is that of smart contracts: self-executing financial
    instruments that synchronize their state, often through a blockchain. One such
    smart contract system that has seen widespread practical adoption is Ethereum,
    which has grown to a market capacity of 100 billion USD and clears an excess of
    500,000 daily transactions.Unfortunately, the rise of these technologies has been
    marred by a series of costly bugs and exploits. Increasingly, the Ethereum community
    has turned to formal methods and rigorous program analysis tools. This trend holds
    great promise due to the relative simplicity of smart contracts and bounded-time
    deterministic execution inherent to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).Here we
    present KEVM, an executable formal specification of the EVM’s bytecode stack-based
    language built with the Framework, designed to serve as a solid foundation for
    further formal analyses. We empirically evaluate the correctness and performance
    of KEVM using the official Ethereum test suite [@ethereum-tests-url]ethereum-tests-url.
    To demonstrate the usability, several extensions of the semantics are presented
    and two different-language implementations of the ERC20 Standard Token are verified
    against the ERC20 specification. These results are encouraging for the executable
    semantics approach to language prototyping and specification.'
